  # VLSI Physical Design Projects - Shivakar Dutt Verma

This repository showcases my hands-on work and learning in **VLSI Physical Design**, focusing on RTL to GDSII flow, layout design, and backend implementation using industry tools like Synopsys IC Compiler II and Cadence Virtuoso.

 🔧 Projects Included
- 🔹 8-bit Full Adder (RTL to GDSII)
- 🔹 4-bit ALU using CMOS layout
- 🔹 Standard Cell Layouts (NAND, NOR, XOR, Half Adder, etc.)
- 🔹 Verilog Testbenches for RTL verification
- 🔹 Floorplanning, Placement, CTS, and Routing flows

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Synopsys Design Compiler, IC Compiler II, Verdi
- Cadence Virtuoso
- Verilog HDL, Shell Scripting, TCL
- Linux Environment

📁 Directory Structure
- `rtl/` – Verilog design files
- `synthesis/` – Scripts and reports from synthesis
- `floorplanning/` – TCL scripts and snapshots
- `layout/` – LEF, GDS, layout reports
